LOADING THE PROGRAM:
	To play the game, double-click on the "DiyaFinalProject.py" file.
	If you would like to read the code, right-click on the file and select "Edit with IDLE."

RUNNING THE CODE:
	Once you've opened the file in reading / editing mode, click on "Run" and then click on "Run Module."
	If you would like to exit the game, click on the "X" in the corner of the game window OR click on the "X" in the corner of the IDLE shell.

HOW TO USE THE CODE / HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
	Once the game starts, you can press the "Play" button with the mouse to start playing.
	If you want to read the instructions, click on the "Instructions" button using the mouse (this page has a button to go back to the intro page once you've read the instructions).
	Once the game starts, move the Pac-Man character (yellow character in the bottom-left corner) using the arrow keys.
	Once the game ends, you can see how long you played (Time), your score, and the high score.
	If you would like to play again / play the next level (if you won the last round), then click on the "Play Again" or "Next Level" button using the mouse.
	If you have started to play the game but would like to go back to the intro screen, you must close the game and re-open the file. 

GAME OBJECTIVE:
	Pac-Man must eat all the pellets in the maze to win.
	Colliding with a ghost will make Pac-Man lose.
	Eating the cherry will give an extra 500 points.
	Once Pac-Man wins, he can play the next level (ghosts and Pac-Man will move faster).
	Try to beat your high score. Once you beat a level, the high score will reset.

GAME ADDITIONS:
	Aside from including all of the Python / Pygame concepts, I added some features using concepts we didn't learn in class:
 		1. Music (starting / stopping music) 
                2. Sound effects (ex. Pac-Man eating pellets, Pac-Man eating cherry, Pac-Man winning / losing)
                3. Buttons with mouse clicks
                4. Changing images in a rect depending on direction and movement (to simulate mouth movement of Pac-Man)
                5. Displaying and updating high score for each game level

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
The game can be navigated using the buttons in the game. However, if you would like to use letter keys instead, there are some options to do so. 
	1) Press 'p' to play
	2) Press 'i' for instructions (can only be used when at the intro screen)
	3) Press 'b' to go to intro screen (cannot be used when playing the game)
	4) Press 'q' to quit
For example, since there isn't a button that allows you to go back to the intro screen after playing a round, you can press 'b' instead and it will take you to the intro screen.
