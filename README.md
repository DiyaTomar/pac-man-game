## About The Project

![game](https://github.com/DiyaTomar/pac-man-game/assets/44855387/cb2a6800-73c4-476e-854b-fd66aa5c0f3c)

This is a Python implementation of the classic Pacman arcade game using the Pygame library.

The player controls Pacman with the arrow keys to move around the maze and eat all the pellets while avoiding ghosts. The game gets progressively harder across levels by increasing the speed of the ghosts. Eating cherries gives extra points. Colliding with a ghost ends the game.

## Features:
* Interactive GUI using Pygame for graphics and input
* Smooth movement and collision detection
* Scorekeeping
* Sound effects and background music
* Game timer
* Multiple levels that increase in difficulty
* Intro, instruction, and game over screens
